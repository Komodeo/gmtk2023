Avoid the knife! Dash to attack the chef!

Use WASD to move and SPACE to dash!

In this world, tomatoes are living, sentient creatures. They are called the Tomatas, and their prince is called Toma-Tim. One day, Toma-Tim gets plucked out of his bush-castle and taken away by a human who wishes to cook the proud prince for a meal. But Toma-Tim isn’t planning on becoming someone else’s grub. Even if his trusty sword and shield got dropped while being carried away, he can hurl himself into his foe. And he’ll roll himself to victory like no tomorrow!
